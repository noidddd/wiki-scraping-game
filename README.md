# wiki-scraping-game
This game extracts data from Wikipedia articles using the Beautiful Soup library.

The objective is to guess the name of an article that is referenced within a specific Wikipedia page as a link. The user inputs a starting article at the beginning of the game, and for each subsequent correct guess the article they input will be used as the new page. A score is calculated which increments by 1 for each correct guess. An incorrect guess will end the game.
